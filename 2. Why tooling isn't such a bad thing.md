# Why tooling and libraries are not such bad things

On february 28th, I watched a talk by Peter Paul Koch, also known as PPK. In his talk, he described what bad evolvements have been taking place on the web last few years. He described there has been an explosion of libraries and tools in the web. Web developers are using more and more libraries and tools every day. 

The loading size of pages have grown enormous, by huge script sizes. He declares mainly libraries are the cause of this.

Besides that, PPK described the rising amount of tools being used in web development. It's becoming harder to keep up with the recent stack of tools being used nowadays, not to talk about the learning curve someone has to approach when learning web development.

## This however is not true

Using libraries and tooling isn't always a bad thing. Let's start with browserify. Browserify is a library that bundles files and modules together by using common.js in your files. To clear this up, if you've never used common.js: common.js is a protocol to bundle modules together, outside the browser. Common.js is for instance also used in node.js. It works like this:

file A:
```js
function myFunction() {
  console.log('test');
}

module.exports = myFunction;
```

file B:
```js
var myFunction = require('./a.js');

myFunction();
// 'test'
```

However, browsers don't support common.js. So when you want to use this code in the browser, you have to bundle these files together. That's were browserify comes in. That's in my opinion the biggest advantage of browserify: it makes you available to make your code modular. Modular code make your code more reusable and more readable. 

Besides bundling your own files together, you can also require npm modules: open source modules built by others. This way, you can easily use others code.
