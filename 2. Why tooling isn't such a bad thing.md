# Why tooling and libraries are not such bad things

On february 28th, I watched a talk by Peter Paul Koch, also known as PPK. In his talk, he described what bad evolvements have been taking place on the web last few years. He described there has been an explosion of libraries and tools in the web. Web developers are using more and more libraries and tools every day. 

The loading size of pages have grown enormous, by huge script sizes. He declares mainly libraries are the cause of this.

Besides that, PPK described the rising amount of tools being used in web development. It's becoming harder to keep up with the recent stack of tools being used nowadays, not to talk about the learning curve someone has to approach when learning web development.

## This however is not true

Using libraries and tooling isn't always a bad thing. Let's start with browserify. Browserify is a library that bundles files and modules together by using common.js in your files. To clear this up, if you've never used common.js: common.js is a protocol to bundle modules together, outside the browser. Common.js is for instance also used in node.js. It works like this:

file A:
```js
function myFunction() {
  console.log('test');
}

module.exports = myFunction;
```

file B:
```js
var myFunction = require('./a.js');

myFunction();
// 'test'
```

However, browsers don't support common.js. So when you want to use this code in the browser, you have to bundle these files together. That's were browserify comes in. That's in my opinion the biggest advantage of browserify: it makes you available to make your code modular. Modular code make your code more reusable and more readable. 

Besides bundling your own files together, you can also require npm modules: open source modules built by others. This way, you can easily use others code. By using browserify, instead of putting all modules as seperate scripts into your html, you save requests. Besides that it makes your module management more easy. 

For example, when you want to use a newer version of an npm module, you just install it. Browserify doesn't care which version of a module you're using. It just loads in the module from your node_modules folder. If you want to use a newer version of an npm module when using seperate scripts in your html, you have to find the url to the newer version and replace the src from your script. A lot more work, and easier to make mistakes

In my opinion, browserify is really a critical tool in web development. It's easy to use and doesn't do weird things. It just bundles your modules together.

### Libraries

As I already mentioned, with browserify you can require others modules (or libraries) and use them in your cose base. This way you can spend time on making cool stuff, instead of reinventing the wheel. Most of the time modules are tested and already in use in production environments, in other words: they work. Using them, saves you time developing these functionality yourself.

Nowadays developers tend to use libraries for single functionality they are building. It isn't bad to use libraries. However, you should always question yourself if you really need that library. Does it only do just what you need?

Don't use React when you just have to some simple DOM manipulations. Don't use the newest features in javascript (like promises and fetch) and prefill them for older browsers, when you could also easily use AJAX requests. Try to always have look critical at which modules and features you're using. This way you don't end up with huge scripts, for the least functionality.
