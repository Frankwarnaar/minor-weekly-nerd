# Building a progressive enhanced realtime poll

Progressive enhancement (PE) is a methodology where you build web apps with the purpose of making it work everywhere from the beginning and adding layers of enhancement after that, to make it work better. In my experience, PE makes the result in the end better, and might even save you some time in development.

For the user PE enhancement is a good thing. Everything works everywhere, no matter what browser you're using or how bad your internet connection is. When your browser supports more features, your experience will improve.

## Layers
PE ussualy contains 3 layers, built in the next order: 
1. Baseline: Start building a baseline that works everywhere. Typically this means using just semantic HTML and doing all the logic server side. Try to restrict yourself to just using forms and links to make your most viable product work.
2. Acceptable: Once you've built the baseline, enhance this layer to make it acceptable for the user. Usually this means enhancing it with CSS. Make it look better. Make sure you don’t actually make things less usable with CSS, for instance by hiding labels of inputs.
3. Enjoyable: Enhance your product to make it work pleasurable. Usually this is where javascript comes in.

## Building a realtime poll

NOTE: In this example i’m just showing the results view. If you want an example of how I’ve built everything else, have a look at my repository [realtime poll](https://github.com/Frankwarnaar/minor-browser-technologies-realtime-poll).

### 1.Baseline
The baseline contains of just semantic HTML:
```html
<html lang="en"><head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Poll</title>
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
	<link href="/css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10">
</head>
<body>
	<h1>How old is Jelmer</h1>
	<ul class="results">
		<li>
			<h2>17</h2>
			<meter max="6" value="2">
				<div class="meter__fill" style="width: 33.33333333333333%"></div>
			</meter>
			<p>2 votes
				<span>(100%)</span>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>18</h2>
			<meter max="6" value="0">
				<div class="meter">
					<div class="meter__fill" style="width: 0%"></div>
				</div>
			</meter>
			<p>0 votes
				<span>(0%)</span>
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
</body>
</html>
```
Notice the `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10">` meta tag in the head. This makes the page refresh every 10 seconds, so this view keeps up to date.

### 2. Acceptable
With CSS I made it look some better.
