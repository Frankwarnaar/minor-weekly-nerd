# Pub sub pattern

## What is it?
Pub sub is a pattern used for message handling. It works with three parties: publishers, subscribers and a middleman.

### Publishers
Publishers are the senders of messages. Messages are when an event is finished. 

### Subscribers
Subscribers are the receivers of those messages. They tell the server they want to receive publishes of certains types. Publishers won't have to know who the subscribers are. 

### Server
The server is the middleman between sender and receiver. The server registers which subscribers are subscribed to which messages. When a message comes in of a certain type, it looks up the subscribers on that type and sends the message to them.

## Advantages
### 1. Independency
Publishers don't need to know to whom they have to send their messages. This reduces complexity.

### Example
[Youtube](//www.youtube.com) works with pub sub too. A video creator publishes a video. Some users of youtube are subscribed to this video creator. They receive the video in their content feed.
