# 2017-02-28 - Peter Paul Koch
On the 28th of february founder of Fronteers, Peter Paul Koch came by to talk about what's wrong with web development right now. He described for major problems.

## Emulate native apps
Back-end and app developers often give web developers the feeling they aren't real developers. Web developers want to proove them wrong and make amazing things. This often leads to emulating native apps on the web. According to Peter Paul, this shouldn't be done. If you emulate native apps, you're always a step behind. Besides that, native apps communicate directly with the operating system of the device. Web apps always have the browser in between them. Web apps wil always be slighly slower because of this.

## Emulating native apps causes browsers to add more features.
To emulate native apps, we need more functionality. We need to get access to the GPS, Camera, etc... The stack of available features in browsers is enormous. We keep on building new features. However, we should focus on improving the UX of these features.

## Too many tools
We keep on using more tools, libraries and frameworks. With more tools, libraries and frameworks the size of our scripts get bigger and bigger and the web gets slower and slower. Besides that, debugging becomes even harder.

## We think the web is a uniformal platform
It's not. The web is different on every different browser, on every different device. We have to accept this. This is the power of the web. It works everywhere. We shoud stop trying to make everything look and behave the same everywhere.
