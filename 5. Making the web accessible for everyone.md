# Making the web accessible for everyone

On february 28th 2017 I visited a talk by Bram Duvigneau, a blind developer and accesibility tester. He talked about how to browse the web, when you're blind or have an other disability. He described how the accessibility of the web has been decreasing for the last few years, mainly because of javascript frameworks and other cutting edge techniques, such as WebGL animations. 

Inaccessibility is a problem, because it makes the web inaccessible for more users then you probably thought. Not only blind people use screen readers, but also people with autism, illiteracy or dyslexic people.

You might still think it's not worth the effort of making your site accessible, but doing so, will also make your site score better in search engines.

In this article I will describe a few tips and ticks for improving the accessibility of your website / webapp.

## 1. Headings
People using screen readers will scan a page by jumping towards headings. Make sure you use the right heading tag for each heading. Each page should just have one single `<h1>` tag, which is the most important title of the entire page. After that, you can start using `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>`. Use a lower level heading when something is less important than the higher level one. Don't skip heading levels.

## 2. Buttons and links
When something is clickable, make sure you use a `<button>` or `<a>` (link) tag. These tags are focusable by default. Try to avoid putting click listeners on other elements with javascript. Using javascript click listeners isn't a bad thing, but make sure it's done on buttons or links. When you use javascript to make a `<div>` element click clickable, users using their keyboard to navigate through the page, will not be able to focus or interact with it.

### Describing names
Use describing content inside buttons and links. Don't use text such as `click here`. When you navigate to it with a screen reader, you will have a lack of context, so you will not know where the button or link will lead you to.

### Don't hijack links with javascript listeners
People will expect that links will take you to another page. It might be confusing when you're still on the same page after you clicked a link.

## 3. Provide descriptions for visual information
Blind users can't get information from your visuals. Make sure your `<img>` tags always have an `alt` attribute as well, to describe the image. Besides blind users, this will also help users when your images don't load.

## 4. Don't overwrite the users preferences
Make sure when styling your site, you don't use absolute sizes and layouts (`px`). Instead, use relative units (`%`, `em`). This way, your site will scale on top of the users preferences, instead of overwriting them. This way users can browse the web with bigger font-size, when they want. Besides that, don't disable zooming on your page. When users can't read or see your content well, you probably did something wrong and your user want to still see it. Don't make this impossible.

## 5. Make sure your tables are built with correct semantics
Make sure your table contains a `thead` with `th` elements inside it. When your using regular `td` elements, with bold styling for example, users who can't see your table, will not be able to know what a field is what.
