# Making the web accessible for everyone

On february 28th 2017 I visited a talk by Bram Duvigneau, a blind developer and accesibility tester. He talked about how to browse the web, when you're blind or have an other disability. He described how the accessibility of the web has been decreasing for the last few years, mainly because of javascript frameworks and other cutting edge techniques, such as WebGL animations. This is a problem, because it makes the web inaccessible for more users then you probably thought. Not only blind people use screen readers, but also people with autism, illiteracy or dyslexic people.

In this article I will describe a few tips and ticks for improving the accessibility of your website / webapp.

## 1. Headings
People using screen readers will scan a page by jumping towards headings. Make sure you use the right heading tag for each heading. Each page should just have one single `<h1>` tag, which is the most important title of the entire page. After that, you can start using `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>`. Use a lower level heading when something is less important than the higher level one. Don't skip heading levels.

## 2. Buttons and links
When something is clickable, make sure you use a `<button>` or `<a>` (link) tag. These tags are focusable by default. Try to avoid putting click listeners on other elements with javascript. Using javascript click listeners isn't a bad thing, but make sure it's done on buttons or links. When you use javascript to make a `<div>` element click clickable, users using their keyboard to navigate through the page, will not be able to focus or interact with it.

### Describing names
Use describing content inside buttons and links. Don't use text such as `click here`. When you navigate to it with a screen reader, you will have a lack of context, so you will not know where the button or link will lead you to.
