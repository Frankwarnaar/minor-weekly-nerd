# 2017-02-07 - Stephen Hay
On the 7th of february, UX designer Stephen Hay was invited to the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. He didn't have the time to prepare a talk, so that's why he came over for a Q&A about is expertise.

Stephen started by introducing himself. He told he studied graphic design & art. From 2004 to 2005 he worked on guidelines for accessability on the web.

## miscommunication
Later on, Stephen told us people in teams don't communicate enough. A lot of designers make a design and hand it over to the developers, without talking to them about it. After that, the developers don't come back to the designers with questions often enough. This results in errors. Developers often notice something is weird, but think it's part of the design.

## Responsive design
Stephen has been writing for the last seven years about responsive design. He wrote a book about this, called [Responsive Design Workflow](https://www.amazon.com/Responsive-Design-Workflow-Stephen-Hay/dp/0321887867). He gave for major tips for making responsive designs:
1. Start sketching. Keep on sketching after five minutes. In the first 5 minutes you will sketch the basic stuff everybody sketches. After this it gets hard, but that's when you're getting creative.
2. Get into the browser as quickly as possible.
3. Always start mobile first (this way, you have to prioritize your content).
4. Make your screen small and start making it bigger. Fix things when they break. 

## New challenges
According to Stephen, after Responsive Design, these are the next big new challenges for the web:
1. UX and visual design have to merge together.
2. Developers can't keep up with all the new libraries, frameworks and tools. That's why you have to invest in learning the basics, so you understand the core of all these.
