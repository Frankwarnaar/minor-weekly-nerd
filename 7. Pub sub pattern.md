# Pub sub pattern

## What is it?
Pub sub is a pattern used for message handling. It works with three parties: publishers, subscribers and a middleman.

### Publishers
Publishers are the senders of messages. Messages are when an event is finished. 

### Subscribers
Subscribers are the receivers of those messages. They tell the server they want to receive publishes of certains types. Publishers won't have to know who the subscribers are. 

### Server
The server is the middleman between sender and receiver. The server registers which subscribers are subscribed to which messages. When a message comes in of a certain type, it looks up the subscribers on that type and sends the message to them.

## Example
[Youtube](//www.youtube.com) works with pub sub too. A video creator (publisher) publishes a video. Some users of youtube are subscribed to this video creator (subscribers). The server checks which users are subscribed to this publisher and puts the video in their content feed.

## Advantages
### 1. Independency
Publishers don't need to know to whom they have to send their messages. This reduces complexity.

### 2. Efficiency
Often messages that are sent, contains multiple types of content. By splitting these and sending just the messages subscribed too, data traffic is reduced. This will also reduce server load.

## Disadvantages
### 1. Delivery confirmation
Because publishers don't know to whom they are publishing, it is harder to confirm if their publishment has been received.

### 2. No relation between publisher and subscriber
By default, publishers and subscribers won't know the sitation of the other. This can be fixed by setting up subscriptions for both parties to publishes by the other about their situation and publishing the sitation of each.

### 3. You have to prevent users from illegally publishing and subscribing on certain types of messages
By default, subscribers and publishers will be able to publish an subscribe to all types of messages. Probably this won't be what you wan't so you have to check if each has the rights to do so.
