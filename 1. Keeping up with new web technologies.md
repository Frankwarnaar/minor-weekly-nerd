# Keeping up with new web technologies

Nowadays web technologies rise faster than ever before. New frameworks, libraries and even types of javascript keep popping up. After reponsive design, this might be the next challenge for web developers. How can I keep up with all these new technologies, tools and features? **You don't.**

## Get to know your basics
In the end, everything in the browser is is `html`, `css` and `javascript`. You should rather master these than try to keep up with frameworks and libraries. These frameworks and libraries all come down to these basic languages after all. When you master these technologies, it will make you understand libraries and frameworks even faster when you decide you are going to use them.

### Evolvements
For example, React is the hottest javascript framework right now. 2 years ago, this was Angular. In 2 years, probably Vue will be taking over. Should you be learning React or Vue then? **No!** Learn javascript. In the end Angular, React and Vue all come down to javascript. When you master one framework, by the time you did this, the next framework is hot probably and then you will have to master that one. Don't try to follow the mass, because you will always be one step behind. When you learn the basics, you are always a step ahead.

## Features
But there are so much new features coming up all the time, how do I keep up with all these? In my opinion it is important to stay op to date with what's booming in the branche.
